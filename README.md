# persona

## Problem Statement 
The company is launching a new marketing campaign for pet insurance, help us create the "Personas" you see fit to help brand marketing. 

## Project Highlights
This analysis centers on cohort-based exploration of a rich demographic dataset to uncover key customer insights. Through targeted EDA and segmentation, I identified the top three personas that align best with the upcoming pet insurance marketing campaign.  

## Outcome
This analysis resulted in actionable recommendations to guide the company’s pet insurance marketing strategy:

- Identified households with young girls aged 7–13 as a high-potential segment, given their strong correlation with pet ownership.
- Recommended geographic targeting in:
  - California (split evenly between Bay Area and SoCal),
  - Arizona (top-performing Eastern market),
  - North Carolina (leading in the Southwest).

- Determined that income data was unreliable due to data gaps and indirect reporting, and recommended excluding it from persona definitions.
- Proposed a tiered insurance pricing model ($15 and $45/month) to accommodate varying financial capacities across regions.

These insights provide a focused audience profile and product strategy to maximize campaign relevance, reach, and conversion.

1. A selection of customer demographic data, which includes a unique ID number, first name, date of birth, monthly income, and more.

2. A jupyter notebook to showcase the coding scripts and outcomes of data cleaning and manipulation, descriptive summary statistics, exploratiry data analysis, and data visualiozation using the provided dataset.

## What is the source of the data?
